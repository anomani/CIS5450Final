our objective was to create a predictive model about whether a customer will churn or not based on specific variables explaining their behavior. Our ultimate objective was to understand the significance of various features on the churn rate of customers.

To this end, we selected a dataset with data from the entertainment industry. We found churn rate to be a particularly interesting topic in the entertainment industry because it is a contractual business with discrete payments made monthly or annually (subscriptions). Therefore, looking at the behavior of customers could help us yield insights regarding the factors that contribute to customers canceling their subscriptions. The analysis that we have conducted allows businesses in the industry to understand the various factors and take proactive approaches to retain customers, increase customer lifetime value, and stabilize their revenue stream.
